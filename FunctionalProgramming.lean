# Functional Programming

We take a closer look at the essence of typed functional programming: inductive types, proofs by
induction, recursive functions, pattern matching, structures (records), and type classes. The
concepts covered here are described in more detail in Chapters 7 to 9 of
[Theorem Proving in Lean](./bib.md#1).
